Commit Filter for GitHub
===

Commit Filter is a Chrome extension that lets you filter out certain files when you're reviewing commits and pull requests.

This is useful if you have build files committed to your repository for example.

The filtered files can be set with regular expressions on the filename and name of the repository.
The files are only hidden and can be revealed if necessary.
